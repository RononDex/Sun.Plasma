Bugfixes:
 - Network related stuff (for example loading news feed) now also works when you are behind a proxy
 - AppData files (logfiles, SunLogin.blob) now get stored correctly in their own subfolder instead of directly in %APPDATA%
 - Increased security when storing credentials using "Remember Me" in the login screen. Your credentials are now getting encrypted using a 2048-bit key that changes everytime you log in, and the key is safely stored in your registery only your user can access.
 - Fixed a bug, where the ScrollWheel in the news window would not work

New stuff:
 - Updated from .Net Framework v4.0 to .Net Framework v4.5
 - New option on login screen to automatically launch application on windows startup (will be moved to Settings window later)
 - Added "Coming Soon" screens to menu entries that are not implemented yet.
 - Added "Fleet Resources" menu item, that opens browsers with the fleet resources 
 - Some UI / style adjustements (rounded window corners, ...)
 - Star Citizen can now be launched directly from Sun.Plasma
 
 Projects to publish:
